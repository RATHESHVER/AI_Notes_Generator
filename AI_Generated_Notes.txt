**Questions (5 marks each):**

1. Describe the concept of aggregates in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). How do they differ from relational databases?
Answer: Aggregates refer to complex structures that treat related objects as a unit for data manipulation and consistency management. This differs from relational databases, which focus on storing data in tables with defined relationships.

2. Compare and contrast the data model oriented around a relational database versus an aggregate data model.
Answer: A relational database focuses on storing data in tables with defined relationships, whereas an aggregate data model treats related objects as a unit for data manipulation and consistency management.

3. Explain how aggregates can be used to manage data consistency in an e-commerce scenario. Provide examples of aggregates that could be used.
Answer: Aggregates can be used to manage data consistency by treating related objects as a unit. For example, in an e-commerce scenario, the customer aggregate could include information about billing addresses and orders, ensuring that data is consistent across different parts of the system.

**Questions (10 marks each):**

1. Design an aggregate data model for an e-commerce website that includes user information, product catalog, orders, shipping addresses, and payment data. Explain how this model ensures data consistency.
Answer: The aggregate data model could include customer and order aggregates, with relationships between them. For example, the customer aggregate could contain a list of billing addresses, while the order aggregate contains a list of orders related to each customer.

2. Compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of using an aggregate data model versus a relational database in an e-commerce scenario.
Answer: An aggregate data model provides better support for complex relationships between objects, whereas a relational database is more suitable for storing large amounts of structured data. However, an aggregate data model may require more complex queries to manage data consistency, while a relational database can provide faster query performance.

Here are the requested study notes, key points, questions, and more:

**Study Notes**

* Data placement: Place data close to where it's being accessed for better performance.
* Load balancing: Distribute load evenly across nodes to avoid bottlenecks.
* Domain-specific rules: Use domain-specific rules to manage load distribution over time.
* Aggregation: Combine data that may be read in sequence to improve processing efficiency.

**Key Points**

1. Data placement is crucial for good performance, so place it close to where it's being accessed.
2. Load balancing is important to distribute the load evenly across nodes.
3. Domain-specific rules can help manage load distribution over time.
4. Aggregating data that may be read in sequence can improve processing efficiency.

**Short, Clear Study Notes**

* Sharding: distributing data across multiple nodes (shards) for better performance and scalability.
* Auto-sharding: some NoSQL databases automatically allocate data to shards and manage access.
* Benefits:
	+ Improves read and write performance
	+ Allows horizontal scaling of writes
* Limitations:
	+ Does little to improve resilience when used alone
	+ May lead to loss of data availability if a node fails

**Important Key Points**

1. Sharding is a technique for distributing data across multiple nodes (shards) to improve performance and scalability.
2. Auto-sharding can simplify sharding by automating the allocation of data to shards.
3. Sharding can improve read and write performance, but may not provide sufficient resilience.

**2-Mark Questions**

1. What is the main benefit of sharding in a database?
a) Improves resilience
b) Improves read and write performance
c) Simplifies data management

Answer: b) Improves read and write performance

2. What is auto-sharding, and what does it do?
a) It allocates data to shards manually
b) It automatically allocates data to shards and manages access
c) It provides additional resilience for the database

Answer: b) It automatically allocates data to shards and manages access

Answer: (Show all relevant points from the content)

2. What are some limitations of using sharding alone? How does it compare to having a single server?
Answer: (Show all relevant points from the content)

**10-Mark Questions**

1. Compare and contrast the benefits of replication, caching, and sharding in improving database performance.
Answer: (Show all relevant points from the content, and explain how each technique addresses different needs)

2. Design a scenario where sharding would be particularly valuable for an application with high write traffic. How would you implement it?
Answer: (Show your understanding of sharding principles and how to apply them in a specific context)

**Study Notes**

Sharding:
- Can decrease resilience due to node failure
- Requires careful planning and execution
- Best used when load projections indicate a need for more resources
- Should be implemented before reaching capacity, to avoid performance issues

**Important Key Points**

1. Sharding alone can decrease resilience due to node failures.
2. Sharding should be carefully planned and executed.
3. Sharding is best suited for databases with high load projections.
4. Sharding should be implemented before reaching capacity to avoid performance issues.

**Short Questions (2 marks each)**

1. What is a potential downside of using sharding?
Answer: Decreased resilience due to node failure.

2. When is it recommended to implement sharding?
Answer: Before reaching capacity, when load projections indicate a need for more resources.

3. Why should sharding not be implemented too late in the development process?
Answer: Because it can consume all database resources for moving data onto new shards, making the database essentially unavailable.

**Medium Questions (5 marks each)**

1. What are some considerations that teams should take into account when deciding to use sharding?
Answer: Decreased resilience due to node failure, careful planning and execution, high load projections, and avoiding performance issues by implementing it before reaching capacity.

2. How can sharding be effectively implemented in a database system?
Answer: By carefully planning and executing the sharding process, starting with single-node configuration and gradually moving to shard-based systems, and ensuring sufficient resources for data movement.

3. What are some potential consequences of implementing sharding too late in the development process?
Answer: The database may become essentially unavailable due to consumed resources, performance issues, and decreased resilience due to node failure.
